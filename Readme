Frontend working Student Challenge

A bootstrap example to embed d3.js histogram in a simple HTML page.

To create a single HTML page, the page was designed using https://getbootstrap.com with

<!-- jsDelivr, -->

a free open source CDN including jQuery and Popper.js and a few custom internal CSS.

The page is made up of a bootstrap sticky footer, navbar with (menu links) and d3.js histogram.

D3.js histogram is loaded by the d3.js javascript library from https://d3js.org/d3.v4.js and
then displayed by an internal d3.js javascript code.

No additional dependencies or 3rd party libraries were installed, the entire page was designed
using open source bootstrap CDN and d3.js javascript library. The page is properly explained with comments.
The page is also responsive
